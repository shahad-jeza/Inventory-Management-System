# Stock Management System

## Project Overview
This project is a simple stock management system implemented in Java. It includes:

- **Product Management**: Tracks stock levels and suggests restocking based on sales trends.
- **Order Processing**: Manages customer orders with automatic status updates using multithreading.
- **Multi-Threaded Background Order Processing**: Uses Java's ExecutorService to handle multiple orders concurrently.
- **Merge Conflict Demonstration**: Simulates and resolves merge conflicts in Git.

## Features
- **Product Class**: Stores product details such as ID, name, price, stock level, and reorder threshold.
- **Stock Predictor**: Estimates when stock will run out and suggests a restocking strategy.
- **Order Class**: Represents customer orders with unique IDs and statuses.
- **Order Manager**: Processes orders and updates their statuses in separate threads.
- **Multi-Threaded Background Order Processing**: 
  - Uses ExecutorService to process multiple orders concurrently.
  - Ensures proper synchronization for correct order status updates.
- **Merge Conflict Handling**: Demonstrates a Git merge conflict and its resolution.
